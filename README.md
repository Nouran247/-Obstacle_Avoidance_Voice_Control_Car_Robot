# -Obstacle_Avoidance_Voice_Control_Car_Robot
The Obstacle Avoidance Voice Control Car Robot is an Arduino-based project where the robot navigates autonomously, avoiding obstacles. It is controlled via voice commands using a voice recognition module and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection. This was my first robot project, developed as part of a team.
